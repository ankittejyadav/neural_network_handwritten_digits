## 🌟 Architectural Vision & System Design

The system is architected as a modular, deterministic machine learning pipeline designed for reproducible training, evaluation, and inference. Rather than treating the model as an isolated script, the codebase is structured to mirror production-grade ML workflows, separating data ingestion, preprocessing, model compilation, and evaluation phases.

### Core Data & System Flow
*   **Ingestion / Input**: Raw 28x28 grayscale pixel matrices are ingested as vectorized NumPy arrays. The ingestion layer handles boundary validation to ensure input tensors conform to expected dimensional constraints.
*   **Processing / Logic**: The execution pipeline performs deterministic min-max scaling, mapping pixel intensities from $[0, 255]$ to a normalized $[0.0, 1.0]$ float32 space. This prevents gradient explosion and ensures numerical stability. The normalized tensors are then flattened into a 1D feature vector ($784$ dimensions) to feed the input layer of the network.
*   **Persistence & Caching**: Training states, weight matrices, and bias vectors are managed in-memory via TensorFlow's computational graph. The architecture is designed to support serialization to standard HDF5/SavedModel formats for downstream deployment to edge devices or cloud inference APIs.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Engineering Decisions

Every technology choice was guided by the balance between mathematical precision, execution speed, and developer velocity.

*   **Frontend / Presentation Layer**: **Jupyter Notebooks** serve as the interactive execution and visualization layer. This allows for real-time inspection of intermediate tensor states, loss curves, and confusion matrices, accelerating the iterative feedback loop.
*   **ML Engine & APIs**: **TensorFlow & Keras** were selected to leverage their highly optimized C++ backends, automatic differentiation engines, and seamless abstraction of computational graphs. This ensures that the underlying matrix multiplications are executed
